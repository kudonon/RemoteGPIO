This is a basic template of the Remote GPIO control
of a Raspberry Pi. Using this template, one can customize
and create an entire controlboard for their Raspberry Pi.
 
The project is a website hosted on the pi that contains a 
form that, once executed, will send a shell command to turn
the pin on.
