This is a basic template of the Remote GPIO control
of a Raspberry Pi. Using this template, one can customize
and create an entire controlboard for their Raspberry Pi.
 
The project is a website hosted on the pi (var/www/html) that 
contains a php form that, once executed, will send a shell command 
to turn the Pi's GPIO pins on.
